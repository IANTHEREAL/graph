It provides information about recent deadlock errors encountered on the current TiDB node...\\\"\\n\\n    The descriptions consistently reinforce that these entities represent the same thing:\\n    *   All three describe a table (`system table`, `table`, `DEADLOCKS table`) that stores deadlock information.\\n    *   Entity 33924 and 362784 explicitly place this table within `information_schema` and specify its scope as the \\\"current TiDB node\\\" or \\\"each TiDB node.\\\"\\n    *   While the description for entity 42849 is more succinct (\\\"A table in TiDB that stores deadlock information\\\"), its highly specific name (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DEADLOCKS`) leaves no ambiguity that it refers to the same table mentioned by the other two entities.\\n    *   The more detailed description of entity 362784 further confirms this by stating, \\\"The DEADLOCKS table is part of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA in TiDB...\\\" and even mentions its relationship to `CLUSTER_DEADLOCKS` (\\\"It also serves as a source of combined information for the CLUSTER_DEADLOCKS\\\"), which distinguishes it from the cluster-level table.\\n\\n3.  **Adherence to Redundancy Guidelines**:\\n    *   **Definition**: The three entities are \\\"distinct entity entries represent[ing] the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\\\" The type is a 'system table' and the instance is the specific `DEADLOCKS` table in `information_schema` on a TiDB node.\\n    *   **Identification**: The entities have \\\"highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\\\" The distinctions are primarily in the choice of name (shorthand, fully qualified, descriptive) and the level of detail in the description, not in the fundamental concept being represented.\\n    *   **Exclusion**: These entities do not represent different levels in a hierarchy or distinct but related concepts. They are direct, overlapping representations of the same singular object.\\n\\nTherefore, the reasoning provided in the issue description is accurate. These three entities introduce redundancy into the knowledge graph, violating the 'Non-redundant' quality objective.

After careful analysis, the issue is deemed valid, as a specific form of redundancy exists within the identified set, although the reasoning provided is somewhat imprecise for the entire group of relationships.\\n\\n**Detailed Analysis:**\\n\\n1.  **Correction of Affected Relationships:** The provided list of affected relationships is `[242589, 32911, 60213, 33552, 92635, 46481]`. Relationship `242589` is incorrectly included. Its definition is:\\n    *   `242589`: Source: \\\"TiDB\\\" (1590025), Target: \\\"autocommit statement retry\\\" (242699), Relationship: \\\"TiDB supports autocommit statement retry to automatically retry statements in case of failure.\\\"\\n    This relationship does not involve \\\"Pessimistic Transaction Mode\\\" (ID 1320209) as the target entity. Therefore, it's not relevant to the core claim about redundancy between 'TiDB' and 'Pessimistic Transaction Mode'. The critique will focus on the remaining five relationships: `32911`, `60213`, `33552`, `92635`, and `46481`, all of which correctly connect 'TiDB' (Source ID 1590025) to 'Pessimistic Transaction Mode' (Target ID 1320209).\\n\\n2.  **Examination of the Relevant Relationships:**\\n    Let's denote 'Pessimistic Transaction Mode' as PTM.\\n    *   `33552`: \\\"TiDB supports pessimistic transaction mode.\\\" (Essentially: TiDB `supports` PTM)\\n    *   `60213`: \\\"TiDB supports pessimistic transaction mode starting from v3.0.\\\" (Essentially: TiDB `supports_since_v3.0` PTM)\\n    *   `46481`: \\\"TiDB uses the pessimistic transaction model by default.\\\" (Essentially: TiDB `uses_by_default` PTM)\\n    *   `32911`: \\\"TiDB uses pessimistic transaction mode by default since version 3.0.8.\\\" (Essentially: TiDB `uses_by_default_since_v3.0.8` PTM)\\n    *   `92635`: \\\"TiDB supports pessimistic transaction mode and uses it by default.\\\" (Essentially: TiDB `supports` PTM AND `uses_by_default` PTM)\\n\\n3.  **Assessing Redundancy based on Guidelines:**\\n    The guideline for redundancy is: \\\"Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities ... with the same semantic meaning.\\\" The non-redundancy example `User → Purchased in 2023 → Product` and `Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product` indicates that qualifications like dates (and by extension, versions) can make relationships distinct.\\n\\n    *   **General vs. Version-Specific Statements:**\\n        *   Comparing `33552` (TiDB `supports` PTM) and `60213` (TiDB `supports_since_v3.0` PTM): These do not have the *same* semantic meaning. `60213` provides additional, specific version information. Based on the non-redundancy example, this difference is significant. Thus, `33552` and `60213` are not redundant with each other.\\n        *   Similarly, `46481` (TiDB `uses_by_default` PTM) and `32911` (TiDB `uses_by_default_since_v3.0.8` PTM) are not redundant with each other.\\n\\n    *   **Support vs. Default Usage:**\\n        Statements about *supporting* PTM (e.g., `33552`) are semantically different from statements about *using PTM by default* (e.g., `46481`). They describe different aspects of TiDB's relationship with PTM.\\n\\n    *   **Composite Statement Redundancy:**\\n        Relationship `92635` states: \\\"TiDB supports pessimistic transaction mode and uses it by default.\\\" This relationship combines two distinct facts: (1) TiDB supports PTM, and (2) TiDB uses PTM by default.\\n        The semantic content of `92635` is equivalent to the conjunction of the semantic content of `33552` (\\\"TiDB supports pessimistic transaction mode.\\\") and `46481` (\\\"TiDB uses the pessimistic transaction model by default.\\\").\\n        If both `33552` and `46481` are present in the graph (and they are listed among the affected relationships), then `92635` is redundant. It does not introduce any new atomic piece of information that isn't already covered by the combination of `33552` and `46481`. This aligns with the quality objective of a \\\"Non-redundant\\\" graph that \\\"avoids duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Conclusion on Validity:**\\n    The issue's reasoning that \\\"Multiple relationships ... convey essentially the same connection\\\" is an oversimplification for the entire set. The relationships `33552`, `60213`, `46481`, and `32911` each convey distinct nuances (general support, versioned support, general default usage, versioned default usage).\\n\\n    However, the issue is **valid** because it has identified a set of relationships containing a genuine redundancy: relationship `92635` is redundant if relationships `33552` and `46481` are also present. Since all three (`92635`, `33552`, `46481`) are part of the analyzed set (after correcting for `242589`), the claim of redundancy holds for this specific case.\\n\\n    To improve graph quality, `92635` could be removed if `33552` and `46481` are deemed the preferred atomic representations of these facts. Alternatively, if a hierarchy of specificity is desired, the more general statements (`33552`, `46481`) could be considered redundant if their more specific, versioned counterparts (`60213`, `32911`) exist, but this type of subsumption redundancy is not explicitly what the provided definition targets, which focuses on \\\"same semantic meaning.\\\"\\n\\nIn summary, while the broad assertion of the issue's reasoning is imprecise, it correctly flags a group of relationships where at least one clear instance of redundancy (the composite relationship `92635` relative to `33552` and `46481`) exists.\"\n",

This assessment is largely valid, particularly concerning relationships 45178 and 46478.\\n\\n**Analysis of Affected Relationships:**\\n\\n1.  **Target Entity Redundancy**: \\n    *   Relationship 46478 points to \\\"Optimistic Transaction Model\\\" (ID: 690060).\\n    *   Relationship 45178 points to \\\"Optimistic Transaction Mode\\\" (ID: 1320043).\\n    The entities 690060 (\\\"Optimistic Transaction Model\\\") and 1320043 (\\\"Optimistic Transaction Mode\\\") are highly likely redundant duplicates. Their names are near-identical, and their descriptions both define the concept of optimistic transactions in TiDB, albeit with slightly different details and focuses. The 'Redundant Relationships' guideline allows for identifying redundancy when target entities are themselves redundant duplicates.\\n\\n2.  **Redundancy between Relationship 45178 and 46478**:\\n    *   **Relationship 45178**: Source: \\\"TiDB\\\" (1590025), Target: \\\"Optimistic Transaction Mode\\\" (1320043), Description: \\\"TiDB supports optimistic transaction mode.\\\"\\n    *   **Relationship 46478**: Source: \\\"TiDB\\\" (1590025), Target: \\\"Optimistic Transaction Model\\\" (690060), Description: \\\"TiDB supports the optimistic transaction model.\\\"\\n    Assuming entities 1320043 and 690060 are redundant, these two relationships connect the same source entity (\\\"TiDB\\\") to conceptually the same target entity (\\\"Optimistic Transaction Model/Mode\\\"). Their descriptions, \\\"TiDB supports optimistic transaction mode\\\" and \\\"TiDB supports the optimistic transaction model,\\\" convey the exact same semantic meaning: TiDB provides support for the optimistic transaction mechanism. This aligns perfectly with the issue's reasoning and the definition of a redundant relationship. Thus, 45178 and 46478 are redundant with each other.\\n\\n3.  **Analysis of Relationship 35611 in context of redundancy**:\\n    *   **Relationship 35611**: Source: \\\"TiDB\\\" (1590025), Target: \\\"Optimistic Transaction Model\\\" (690060), Description: \\\"TiDB uses the optimistic transaction model by default.\\\"\\n    Comparing this with relationship 46478 (\\\"TiDB supports the optimistic transaction model\\\"), both connect the same source and target entities. However, their semantic meanings differ. 'Supports' implies capability or availability, while 'uses by default' specifies a default configuration. This is a meaningful distinction; a system can support multiple models but only use one by default. The information that TiDB uses OTM *by default* is more specific and distinct than merely stating it *supports* OTM. The non-redundancy example in the guidelines (\\\"User → Purchased in 2023 → Product\\\" vs. \\\"Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product\\\") highlights how additional qualifiers can render relationships non-redundant. 'By default' acts as such a qualifier here.\\n    Therefore, relationship 35611 is not redundant with 46478 or 45178, as it conveys a distinct piece of information.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe issue is valid because the set of relationships [35611, 45178, 46478] indeed contains redundancy as per the reasoning provided. Specifically, relationships 45178 and 46478 are redundant, as they both state that TiDB supports the optimistic transaction model/mode, connecting to what are effectively duplicate target entities. \\n\\nHowever, it's important to clarify that relationship 35611, while related, is not redundant with the other two because its semantic content (\\\"uses by default\\\") is distinct from \\\"supports.\\\" The issue's reasoning focuses on \\\"TiDB's support for the optimistic transaction model,\\\" which accurately captures the redundancy between 45178 and 46478. The presence of this clear redundancy within the identified set makes the overall issue valid.\"\n",

The reasoning states that its description, 'Locks held by transactions in TiKV', is too vague and doesn't provide enough context to distinguish it from other lock-related concepts in the graph. This aligns with the 'Ambiguous Definition/Description' subtype of an entity quality issue.\\n\\nHere's a detailed analysis:\\n\\n1.  **Ambiguity regarding Lock Types in TiKV**: TiKV, as the storage layer for TiDB, supports different transaction models, notably pessimistic and optimistic. These models employ distinct locking mechanisms or primitives:\\n    *   **Pessimistic transactions** involve acquiring explicit locks on data keys in TiKV.\\n    *   **Optimistic transactions** involve writing 'lock' information (e.g., during the prewrite phase of 2PC) to key-value pairs, which serve a similar purpose but have different semantics and lifecycles than pessimistic locks.\\n    The current name 'locks' and description 'Locks held by transactions in TiKV' are too general. They do not specify whether entity `31082` refers to: \\n    a)  A general category encompassing all such transactional lock primitives in TiKV.\\n    b)  Specifically pessimistic locks in TiKV.\\n    c)  Specifically the lock-column entries or markers used in optimistic transactions.\\n    This lack of specificity makes the entity's precise meaning ambiguous.\\n\\n2.  **Context within the Graph**: The graph contains entities describing these different transaction models, such as 'Pessimistic Transaction Mode' (id: 53184, 1320209) and 'Optimistic Transaction Model' (id: 690060, 1320043). These models intrinsically rely on different types of 'locks' or locking behaviors within TiKV. Entity `31082` fails to clarify its relationship to these specific lock types, making it difficult to understand its precise scope.\\n\\n3.  **Distinction from Other Entities**: While entity `31082` is distinguishable from higher-level or different-purpose lock concepts like 'TiDB User-level locks' (id: 242815, which are application-level and managed in TiDB) or 'Metadata lock' (implied by relationships for entities like 41737 and 31971, used for DDL/DML concurrency), it is not sufficiently distinguished from the various *internal transactional lock types* that TiKV itself would manage.\\n\\n4.  **Violation of 'Precise' Quality Objective**: A high-quality knowledge graph should be 'Precise', meaning entities have clear, unambiguous definitions. The current definition of entity `31082` is not precise enough to identify which specific type of TiKV transactional lock it represents, or if it's an umbrella term for multiple types.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the description for entity `31082` is ambiguous because 'locks held by transactions in TiKV' can refer to different underlying mechanisms with distinct characteristics. To improve clarity, the entity's description (and possibly name) should be refined to specify the type of TiKV transactional lock it refers to, or explicitly define it as a general category if that's the intent.\"\n",

The description provided, 'A process in TiDB related to lock resolution,' aligns with the 'Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description' subtype of an `entity_quality_issue`.\\n\\nHere's a detailed analysis:\\n\\n1.  **Lack of Specificity**: The description is extremely high-level. While it tells us the entity is a 'process' within 'TiDB' and concerns 'lock resolution,' it omits crucial details. For instance, it doesn't specify:\\n    *   The types of locks this process resolves (e.g., row locks, table locks, transactional locks, metadata locks).\\n    *   The context or trigger for this process (e.g., does it occur after transaction completion, deadlock detection, or to clean up orphaned locks?).\\n    *   The actual mechanism or outcome of the 'resolution' (e.g., releasing locks, notifying waiting transactions, rolling back operations).\\n    *   Its specific role or component within the broader TiDB architecture. Is it part of TiKV, TiDB server, or another component?\\n\\n2.  **Comparision with Other Entities**: The graph contains entity `41669` ('Resolving Locking Process') with the description 'The process in TiKV for resolving locks held by transactions.' This description is more informative as it specifies the location (TiKV) and the scope ('locks held by transactions'). In contrast, the description for 'resolve lock' (42413) remains generic, making it difficult to understand its distinct role or if it's a broader, encompassing concept or a different specific mechanism.\\n\\n3.  **Failure to Define or Distinguish**: According to the 'Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description' guideline, a description is problematic if it 'provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity' or 'fails its basic purpose.' The current description for 'resolve lock' is nearly tautological (the 'resolve lock' process resolves locks). It provides minimal information beyond what the name itself suggests. This lack of detail makes it difficult to distinguish this specific process from a general concept of lock resolution or other potential lock-handling mechanisms within TiDB.\\n\\n4.  **Hinders Clarity and Usability**: As per the `Entity Quality Issues` definition, such flaws should 'significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability.' A user trying to understand TiDB's internal workings, particularly its concurrency control and locking mechanisms, would find this description unhelpful. It doesn't clarify 'what exactly this process entails,' which is the core of the reasoning provided for the issue.\\n\\nWhile not entirely 'meaningless' like 'An item,' the description is 'fundamentally vague' because it lacks the substance needed to convey the entity's specific nature and function. It fails the 'Precise' quality objective, which states entities should have 'clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.'

Supporting optimistic mode as an option is compatible with pessimistic mode being the standard or default configuration.\\n\\n2.  **Ambiguity Not Created by This Specific Claimed Contradiction**: Since the premise of a contradiction between 'supports optimistic' and 'pessimistic is default' is incorrect, the conclusion that this specific interaction creates ambiguity about TiDB's primary transaction model is also unfounded. The graph, through relationships such as `32911`, `92635`, and `46481` ('TiDB uses the pessimistic transaction model by default.'), explicitly clarifies that the pessimistic model is the default. This information resolves, rather than creates, ambiguity regarding the primary transaction model.\\n\\nTherefore, the issue, as defined by its specific reasoning, is not valid. The core assertion of a contradiction between supporting optimistic mode and pessimistic mode being default is a misinterpretation of how features and defaults can coexist.\\n\\nIt is worth noting, separately from the issue's reasoning, that relationship `92633` (`TiDB` -- \\\"TiDB supports optimistic transaction mode.\\\" -> `Pessimistic Transaction Mode`) possesses an internal quality flaw: its description refers to 'optimistic transaction mode' while its target entity is 'Pessimistic Transaction Mode'. This mismatch makes relationship `92633` itself fundamentally unclear. However, this internal flaw is different from the contradiction alleged in the issue's reasoning which compares the textual content of `92633` with other distinct relationships.\"\n",

The table stores a limited number of the most recent deadlock events, with a default capacity of 10 in TiDB Cloud and a configurable capacity in self-hosted TiDB deployments via the `pessimistic-txn.deadlock-history-capacity` setting. By default, it does not collect information about retryable deadlock errors, but this behavior can be changed by adjusting the `pessimistic-txn.deadlock-history-collect-retryable` configuration option. Querying this table requires the PROCESS privilege. It also serves as a source of combined information for the CLUSTER_DEADLOCKS.\"\n",

However, in practice, when people refer to system tables, they might use the short name if the schema is implied. So having both \"DEADLOCKS\" and \"INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DEADLOCKS\" as separate entities could be redundant unless there's a distinction. But according to their descriptions, they're the same table.

By default, it does not collect information about retryable deadlock errors, but this behavior can be changed by adjusting the `pessimistic-txn.deadlock-history-collect-retryable` configuration option. Querying this table requires the PROCESS privilege. It also serves as a source of combined information for the CLUSTER_DEADLOCKS.', 'meta': '{\"access_privilege\": \"PROCESS\", \"capacity\": \"By default, stores the 10 most recent deadlock events.
