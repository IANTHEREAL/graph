In calculating your Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus, PingCAP will take into account the Acceleration Multiplier (as described in Section 1).\\n\\nCalculation examples are listed below for your reference.\\n\\nAssume Quota for FY25: 500k, Base Rate: 5%, Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus: 25K\\n\\nQ1:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (Cloud) = 100K\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (non-Cloud) = 90K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q1 = (100K+90K)*5%=9.5K\\n\\nQ2:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (Cloud) = 250k\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (non-Cloud) = 100K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q2 =  500K*5%+(350K+190K-500K)*7.5%-9.5K = 18.5K\\n\\nNote:Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only.\\n\\n### 3.2 Bucket 2 Total Target Bonus\\nBased on your actual Quota Attainment in each Quarter, PingCAP calculates the aggregated ACVs in deals that you have closed and determines the Bucket 2 Total Target Bonus you are entitled to.\\n\\nCalculation examples are listed below for your reference.\\n\\nAssume Quota for FY25 = 300k, Base Rate = 2%, Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus = 6K\\n\\nQ1:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (Cloud): 100K\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (non-Cloud): 90K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q1  = (100K+90K)*2% = 3.8K\\n\\nQ2:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (Cloud): 100k\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (non-Cloud): 0K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q2 = (100K+100K+90K)*2% -3.8K = 2K\\n\\nNote: Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only. Any ACV Bookings over the corresponding ATR from a single customer will be calculated to Bucket 1 as New & Expansion ACV.\\n\\n### 3.3 Multi-year Orders’ Compensation\\n\\nWhen calculating incentives for multi-year deals, it’s crucial to understand the compensation structure, which is divided into two main categories with an additional note for Cloud Commitment Plans:\\n\\n- Multi-year New and Expansion Orders\\n- Multi-year Renewal Orders\\n- Addit\\n\\n1. Multi-year New and Expansion Orders\\n\\nFor Multi-year New and Expansion Orders, besides being compensated for Bucket 1 Target Bonus on your Quota Attainment (for Bucket 1) for the 1st year, you are also entitled to another 2% of ACV for the 2nd year and 2% of ACV for the 3rd year. e.g. in FY25, you closed-won a new 2-year-term deal with ACV as of Y (TCV= 2Y); then for Year 1, your compensation is Y * Bucket 1 Personal Commission Rate, for Year 2, your compensation is Y*2%.\\n\\n2. Multi-year Renewal Orders\\n\\nApplicability: Primarily for On-Premises (OP) deployments involving renewals of existing contracts.\\n\\nFor Multi-year Renewal Orders, besides being compensated for Bucket 2 Target Bonus for the 1st renewal year, you are also entitled to another 2% of ACV for the 2nd year and 2% of ACV for the 3rd year. E.g. in FY25, you closed-won a renewal 2-year-term deal with ACV as of Z (TCV=2Z); then for Year 1, your compensation is Z*2%, for Year 2, your compensation is Z*2%.\\n\\n3. Additional Rules for Multi-year Cloud Commitment Plans\\n\\nFor deals under the Cloud Commitment Plan, there are special considerations due to the variable nature of cloud usage. These rules apply in addition to the above compensation structures for both new/expansion and renewal orders:\\n- if the first year’s usage is over the ACV, the exceeded amount will be considered as the 2nd year’s ACV;\\n- if the first 2 years’ usage is over 2*ACV, the exceeded amount will be considered as the 3rd year’s ACV.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n- These additional rules encourage and reward you for driving higher cloud usage beyond the customer’s initial commitment.\\n- The additional compensation for exceeded usage is on top of the standard multi-year compensation for the committed ACV.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## 4 Compensation & Bonus Payment\\n\\n4.1 Compensation & Bonus Calculation and Payment months, please refer to\\nCompensation & Bonus Payment Calendar / Compensation & Bonus Payment Calendar / Compensation & Bonus Payment Calendar / Compensation & Bonus Payment Calendar.\\n4.2 Your Compensation & Bonus for Bucket 1 and Bucket 2 shall be paid in proportion to the amount that’s been RevReced or Collected by PingCAP.\\n4.2.1 Your Compensation for TiDB Cloud deals will be paid to you only after\\nPingCAP recognizes the revenue. If a Cloud Commitment Plan has an upfront payment, the commission of upfront payment will be triggered at the time of booking, provided that there is no earlier termination clause in the contract, and the commission for the remaining payment will be triggered by Revenue. 4.2.2For the other deals (TiDB Enterprise Subscription, PingCAP Enterprise Service, etc.), 50% of Commission (50% of first year commission for multi-year orders) will be triggered at the booking following the standard commission calculation cycle under the condition that there is no earlier termination clause in the contract, and the commission for the remaining will be triggered by cash-in.\\n4.2.3 If you transfer to a non-Sales role or do not act as the Account Owner to any\\nspecific customer before the order amount is fully revrec’ed or collected, you are entitled to the to-be-paid compensation after PingCAP recognizes or collects the remaining order amount within 1) 90 days after your transfer date, 2) 45 days after the next payment due date from the invoices of your active orders, which one is earlier. After this date, the new sales account owner will get compensation based on 2% commission rate and the remaining revenue or collection, which one is less; if the new sales account owner is not onboard, the original sales account owner will get compensation based on 2% commission rate and the remaining revenue or collection, which one is less. However, if you resign from PingCAP before the receivable order amount is fully RevReced or Collected, you shall not be entitled to the to-be-paid compensation any longer. There will be a true-up or true-down based on the actual ACV, revenue and collections as of your last working day; if the commission amount calculated based on the actual ACV, revenue or collections is lower than the commission already paid, the overpaid commission will be clawed back. The unpaid compensation as of your last working day, will be paid to you according to PingCAP's scheduled commission pay dates, subject to terms and conditions provided hereunder; if local law provides otherwise, local law shall prevail.\\n\"}, {'id': 'a8f4bdce-4cde-48ad-b01d-0c5491a76f0c', 'name': 'FY25 Compensation Related Business Metrics (APAC)', 'link': 'https://pingcap.feishu.cn/wiki/QZIYwkXjmirBAHkoHFGccQY4nph', 'version': 'fy25_v1.0', 'content': \"# FY25 Compensation Related Business Metrics (APAC)\\n**Drafted by:** BE&O\\n**Last Update:** May 21st, 2024\\n| Date | Change Records |\\n| -------------- | ---------------------------- |\\n| May 21st, 2024 | Published |\\n| Sep 12th, 2024 | ATR definition updated. |\\n| Nov 1st, 2024 | ATR definition updated. |\\n\\n## Brand New Cloud Customer\\n1. **Brand New definition:** No Cloud Payment before FY25.
