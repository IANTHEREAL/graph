Key points include: \\u200b\\n\\n1. Net ARR definition ：Net ARR (Net Annual Recurring Revenue) is a key metric for SaaS companies, reflecting annual recurring revenue after considering customer churn, expansions, etc., showing the health of recurring revenue.\\u200b\\n2. Net ARR formula ：Net ARR = Ending ARR - Baseline ARR (Standard Calculation). The baseline for customers is set in different ways based on prior quarter ending ARR, commitment amounts, etc.\\u200b\\n3. Net ARR scenarios for different customer cases ：For customers with new commitment plans in FY26 with or without prior quarter Ending ARR, and those with different relationships between FY25 commitment and FY25 Ending ARR, Net ARR is calculated according to the standard formula with specific baselines.\\u200b\\n4. Net ARR for TiDB Self Host (Subscription Base) ：Baseline = Prior Quarter Ending ARR, Net ARR = Ending ARR - Baseline ARR. Also, ARR = MRR * 12, MRR = Total Contract Value (from recurring revenue)/Total Contract Months.\\u200b\\n5. Special case ：Cloud CP shortfall true-up revenue is not counted in ARR. For example, if the commitment plan is 100K but only 90K is spent, the 10K is not included in ARR. \\n\\n## Net ARR Definition\\n\\n### Explain on Net ARR\\n\\nNet ARR (Net Annual Recurring Revenue) is a key metric for SaaS companies, reflecting the total recurring revenue generated on an annual basis, after accounting for factors such as customer churn, expansions, downgrades, and renewals. It provides a comprehensive view of the recurring revenue health of a SaaS business, considering both losses and gains in the customer base.\\n\\n### Net ARR Formula and Calculation\\n\\nNet ARR = Ending ARR - Baseline ARR (Standard Calculation)\\n\\nThe baseline for the customer will be set as:\\n\\n- Prior Quarter Ending ARR\\n- FY25 Commitment, if it is greater than the FY25 Ending ARR entering FY26. FY25 Commitment will be the baseline until the Ending ARR exceeds the Commitment or the opportunity is renewed.\\n\\nFor multiple year commitment contracts, baseline equals current year/half year(x2) commitment value.\\n\\n## Net ARR Scenarios\\n\\n#### Apply to TiDB Cloud and TiDB Self Host (Consumption Base), examples with values of K$USD\\n\\n##### Case 1: Customers with new commitment plan in FY26 without Ending ARR from prior quarter\\n\\n|                      | FY25Q4 | FY26Q1 | FY26Q2 | FY26Q3 | FY26Q4 |\\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\\n| **Baseline - greater of ending ARR or commitment amount** | 0      | 0      | 150    | 250    | 200    |\\n| **Ending ARR**       | 0      | 150    | 250    | 200    | 250    |\\n| **Commit**           |        |        |        | 250    |        |\\n| **Net ARR (for quota credit and commissions)** |        | **150** | 100    | -50    | 50     |\\n\\n**Explain** : Customers with new commitment plan in FY26 Net ARR follows standard calculation **Ending ARR - Baseline ARR**\\n\\n##### Case 2: Customers with new commitment plan in FY26 with Ending ARR from prior quarter\\n\\n|                                      | FY25Q4 | FY26Q1 | FY26Q2 | FY26Q3 | FY26Q4 |\\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\\n| **Baseline - greater of ending ARR or commitment amount** | 0      | 50     | 150    | 250    | 200    |\\n| **Ending ARR**                       | 50     | 150    | 250    | 200    | 250    |\\n| **Commit**                           |        | 200    |        |        |        |\\n| **Net ARR (for quota credit and commissions)** |        | 100    | 100    | -50    | 50     |\\n\\n\\n**Explain** : Customers with new commitment plan in FY26 Net ARR follows standard calculation **Ending ARR - Baseline ARR**\\n\\n##### Case 3: Customers with FY25 commitment higher than FY25 Ending ARR\\n\\n- 📅 FY25Q4\\n    - **Ending ARR**: 120\\n    - **Commitment**: 200\\n    - **Net ARR**: N/A\\n    - **Baseline for FY26Q1**: 200 (because commitment > ending ARR)\\n    - **Explanation**:  The customer had a FY25 commitment higher than the FY25 ending ARR. 👉 Therefore, the **prior commitment amount (200)** will serve as the **baseline for FY26Q1**.\\n\\n- 📅 FY26Q1\\n    - **Baseline**: 200  \\n    - **Ending ARR**: 180  \\n    - **Commitment**: N/A  \\n    - **Net ARR**: **0**  \\n    - **Explanation**: Since the ending ARR (180) is **lower than the baseline (200)** and the customer did **not renew**, 👉 In this case, **Net ARR = 0** on all non-renewing quarters\\n\\n- 📅 FY26Q2\\n    - **Baseline**: 200  \\n    - **Ending ARR**: 220  \\n    - **Commitment**: N/A  \\n    - **Net ARR**: **20**  \\n    - **Explanation**:  The ending ARR (220) **exceeds the baseline (200)**.  👉 **Net ARR = Ending ARR - Baseline = 220 - 200 = 20**\\n\\n- 📅 FY26Q3\\n    - **Baseline**: 220  \\n    - **Ending ARR**: 250  \\n    - **Commitment**: N/A  \\n    - **Net ARR**: **30**  \\n    - **Explanation**:  \\n    The ending ARR (250) **exceeds the baseline (220)**.  👉 **Net ARR = 250 - 220 = 30**\\n\\n- 📅 FY26Q4\\n    - **Baseline**: 250\\n    - **Ending ARR**: 270\\n    - **Commitment**: 300 (renewal)  \\n    - **Net ARR**: **20**  \\n    - **Explanation**:  The opportunity is **renewed** in this quarter.  👉 In renewal quarters, Net ARR follows the **standard calculation**:  **Net ARR = Ending ARR - Starting ARR = 270 - 250 = 20**\\n\\n##### Case 4: Customers with FY25 commitment higher than FY25 Ending ARR, Churn is applied in the renewing quarter.\\n\\n- 📅 FY25Q4\\n    - **Ending ARR**: 120  \\n    - **Commitment**: 200  \\n    - **Net ARR**: N/A  \\n    - **Baseline for FY26Q1**: 200 (greater of ending ARR or commitment)  \\n    - **Explanation**:  The customer had a FY25 commitment (200) higher than the FY25 ending ARR (120).  👉 Therefore, the **baseline for FY26Q1 is set to 200**.\\n\\n- 📅 FY26Q1\\n    - **Baseline**: 200  \\n    - **Ending ARR**: 180  \\n    - **Commitment**: N/A  \\n    - **Net ARR**: **0**  \\n    - **Explanation**:   Since the ending ARR (180) is **lower than the baseline (200)** and the customer did **not renew**,  👉 **Net ARR = 0**\\n\\n- ...\\n\\n- 📅 FY26Q4\\n    - **Baseline**: 200  \\n    - **Ending ARR**: 190  \\n    - **Commitment**: 150 (renewal)  \\n    - **Net ARR**: **-10**  \\n    - **Explanation**: This is a **renewal quarter**, and churn is applied.  👉 **Net ARR = Ending ARR - Starting ARR = 190 - 200 = -10**\\n\\n##### Case 5.

Therefore ACV remains the same each year throughout contract duration.\\n    - ACV is recognized based on contract date, not service start date\\n    - ACV is after tax amount （China with tax)\\n- Calculation - \\n    - License： ACV = TCV\\n    - Subscription，Professional Servce，MA：ACV = TCV / # of years in contract (minimum 1 year)\\n        - For contracts with less than 1 year duration：ACV = TCV\\n    - Pay-as-you-go contracts: \\n        - ACV = actual revenue\\n    - Contracts with free service period: \\n        - ACV is to be recognized over both paid and free service periods\\n        - e.g. Contract Term: 2021.9.5-2022.9.4，Free service period: 2022.9.5-2022.12.4，TCV 900k ---> ACV = 900k / (12+3)*12 = 720k\\n- Back Dated contracts：\\n    - Recognize TCV & ACV in the same period of contract signature date (not when service started)\\n    - ACV is only recognized at the contract signature date (i.e. No ACV will be recorded for prior fiscal year or quarter)\\n\\n## ARR\\n\\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue. It is a key metric often used by subscription-based businesses or companies with recurring revenue models to measure the predictable and recurring revenue generated over a 12-month period.\\n\\nTypes of Product Family Included: Subscription, TiDB Cloud, MA of Perpetual License (China Only)\\n\\n#### How to Calculate ARR:\\n\\n- Subscription and MA (Unit Discount Model and Average Pricing Model)\\n    - ARR = (Subscription/MA Amount ) / (Term Length in Months) × 12 (to annualize)\\n    - When a quote contains multiple line items with different start and end dates, the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) should be calculated separately for each line item, taking into account the specific term length and the respective value for each item. The individual ARR values for all line items are then aggregated to determine the total order ARR.\"\\n- Subscription  (Consumption Model - least recommended)\\n    - ARR = Average 3 months\\' revenue x 12 (to annualize)\\n- TiDB Cloud\\n    - ARR = Average 3 months\\' revenue x 12 (to annualize)\\n\\n#### ARR Recognition Time: \\n- It usually begins to be recognized starting from the first revenue recognition month—which is generally aligned with the start date of the subscription or contract.\\n- Backdated contract: ARR begins to be recognized from first revenue recognition month and ends with service end month;\\n- Future start contract: No ARR until revenue starts;\\n- Early termination contract: ARR ends if contract terminated earlier than service end date;\\n\\nExample for recognition:\\n1. Backdated Contract: Subscription Amount: $2400/Year, Term: 12 months, Service Start Date: April 1 (Contract signed on June 30)\\n\\n|       | Apr-24 | May-24 | Jun-24 | Jul-24 | Aug-24 | Sep-24 | Oct-24 | Nov-24 | Dec-24 | Jan-25 | Feb-25 | Mar-25 | Total  |\\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\\n| Revenue |        |        |  $598  | $204   | $204   | $197   | $204   | $197   | $204   | $204   | $184   | $204   | $2,400 |\\n| ARR     |        |        | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 | $2,400 |\\n\\n## Revenue\\n\\n1. Revenue is calculated after taxes. It\\'s prorated by # of days in the contract starting with service start date.\\n2. For backdated contracts, revenue catchup for prior periods will be calculated at contract signature date.\\n3. Revenue should be prorated across both paid and free service periods.\\n\\n## RPO/Backlog\\n\\n1. Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) represents the total future performance obligations arising from contractual relationships \\n2. RPO = TCV minus revenue recognition to-date\\n\\n## NRR \\n\\n1. Net Revenue Retention (NRR), aka net dollar retention, meansures how successful a company is at renewing or sustaining customer contracts and how well it is doing at generating additional revenue from this existing customer base.\\n2. Applicable contracts: Subscription, pay-as-you-go and MA\\n3. Calculation -  For example, in order to calculate NRR @ Jul 2021：For any customers that had non-zero MRR in Jul 2020 , NRR = sum of their MRR in Jul 2021 / sum of their MRR in Jul 2020\\n4.

In calculating your Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus, PingCAP will take into account the Acceleration Multiplier (as described in Section 1).\\n\\nCalculation examples are listed below for your reference.\\n\\nAssume Quota for FY25: 500k, Base Rate: 5%, Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus: 25K\\n\\nQ1:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (Cloud) = 100K\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (non-Cloud) = 90K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q1 = (100K+90K)*5%=9.5K\\n\\nQ2:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (Cloud) = 250k\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (non-Cloud) = 100K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q2 =  500K*5%+(350K+190K-500K)*7.5%-9.5K = 18.5K\\n\\nNote:Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only.\\n\\n### 3.2 Bucket 2 Total Target Bonus\\nBased on your actual Quota Attainment in each Quarter, PingCAP calculates the aggregated ACVs in deals that you have closed and determines the Bucket 2 Total Target Bonus you are entitled to.\\n\\nCalculation examples are listed below for your reference.\\n\\nAssume Quota for FY25 = 300k, Base Rate = 2%, Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus = 6K\\n\\nQ1:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (Cloud): 100K\\n- Quota Attainment-Q1 (non-Cloud): 90K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q1  = (100K+90K)*2% = 3.8K\\n\\nQ2:\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (Cloud): 100k\\n- Quota Attainment-Q2 (non-Cloud): 0K\\n- Incentive Compensation-Q2 = (100K+100K+90K)*2% -3.8K = 2K\\n\\nNote: Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only. Any ACV Bookings over the corresponding ATR from a single customer will be calculated to Bucket 1 as New & Expansion ACV.\\n\\n### 3.3 Multi-year Orders’ Compensation\\n\\nWhen calculating incentives for multi-year deals, it’s crucial to understand the compensation structure, which is divided into two main categories with an additional note for Cloud Commitment Plans:\\n\\n- Multi-year New and Expansion Orders\\n- Multi-year Renewal Orders\\n- Addit\\n\\n1. Multi-year New and Expansion Orders\\n\\nFor Multi-year New and Expansion Orders, besides being compensated for Bucket 1 Target Bonus on your Quota Attainment (for Bucket 1) for the 1st year, you are also entitled to another 2% of ACV for the 2nd year and 2% of ACV for the 3rd year. e.g. in FY25, you closed-won a new 2-year-term deal with ACV as of Y (TCV= 2Y); then for Year 1, your compensation is Y * Bucket 1 Personal Commission Rate, for Year 2, your compensation is Y*2%.\\n\\n2. Multi-year Renewal Orders\\n\\nApplicability: Primarily for On-Premises (OP) deployments involving renewals of existing contracts.\\n\\nFor Multi-year Renewal Orders, besides being compensated for Bucket 2 Target Bonus for the 1st renewal year, you are also entitled to another 2% of ACV for the 2nd year and 2% of ACV for the 3rd year. E.g. in FY25, you closed-won a renewal 2-year-term deal with ACV as of Z (TCV=2Z); then for Year 1, your compensation is Z*2%, for Year 2, your compensation is Z*2%.\\n\\n3. Additional Rules for Multi-year Cloud Commitment Plans\\n\\nFor deals under the Cloud Commitment Plan, there are special considerations due to the variable nature of cloud usage. These rules apply in addition to the above compensation structures for both new/expansion and renewal orders:\\n- if the first year’s usage is over the ACV, the exceeded amount will be considered as the 2nd year’s ACV;\\n- if the first 2 years’ usage is over 2*ACV, the exceeded amount will be considered as the 3rd year’s ACV.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n- These additional rules encourage and reward you for driving higher cloud usage beyond the customer’s initial commitment.\\n- The additional compensation for exceeded usage is on top of the standard multi-year compensation for the committed ACV.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## 4 Compensation & Bonus Payment\\n\\n4.1 Compensation & Bonus Calculation and Payment months, please refer to\\nCompensation & Bonus Payment Calendar / Compensation & Bonus Payment Calendar / Compensation & Bonus Payment Calendar / Compensation & Bonus Payment Calendar.\\n4.2 Your Compensation & Bonus for Bucket 1 and Bucket 2 shall be paid in proportion to the amount that’s been RevReced or Collected by PingCAP.\\n4.2.1 Your Compensation for TiDB Cloud deals will be paid to you only after\\nPingCAP recognizes the revenue. If a Cloud Commitment Plan has an upfront payment, the commission of upfront payment will be triggered at the time of booking, provided that there is no earlier termination clause in the contract, and the commission for the remaining payment will be triggered by Revenue. 4.2.2For the other deals (TiDB Enterprise Subscription, PingCAP Enterprise Service, etc.), 50% of Commission (50% of first year commission for multi-year orders) will be triggered at the booking following the standard commission calculation cycle under the condition that there is no earlier termination clause in the contract, and the commission for the remaining will be triggered by cash-in.\\n4.2.3 If you transfer to a non-Sales role or do not act as the Account Owner to any\\nspecific customer before the order amount is fully revrec’ed or collected, you are entitled to the to-be-paid compensation after PingCAP recognizes or collects the remaining order amount within 1) 90 days after your transfer date, 2) 45 days after the next payment due date from the invoices of your active orders, which one is earlier. After this date, the new sales account owner will get compensation based on 2% commission rate and the remaining revenue or collection, which one is less; if the new sales account owner is not onboard, the original sales account owner will get compensation based on 2% commission rate and the remaining revenue or collection, which one is less. However, if you resign from PingCAP before the receivable order amount is fully RevReced or Collected, you shall not be entitled to the to-be-paid compensation any longer. There will be a true-up or true-down based on the actual ACV, revenue and collections as of your last working day; if the commission amount calculated based on the actual ACV, revenue or collections is lower than the commission already paid, the overpaid commission will be clawed back. The unpaid compensation as of your last working day, will be paid to you according to PingCAP's scheduled commission pay dates, subject to terms and conditions provided hereunder; if local law provides otherwise, local law shall prevail.\\n\"}}\n",
