# FY26 SKA/KA Segmentation

## SKA/KA Definition

For FY26 Customer Segmentation, a selected number of accounts are defined as SKA/KA which aligns with our company strategy. These are the accounts to be focused in your target market in FY26.

### SKA

The criteria are:

1. ($1B+ Revenue AND 1000+ employees) with ICP
2. OR $1M+ ARR with PingCAP

SKA Focus on:

- Highest-priority accounts with significant growth potential 
- OR high revenue contribution ($1M+ ARR) to PingCAP

These are customers with significant influence on the product roadmap, requiring deep customization and long-term strategic engagement.

### KA

The criteria are:

1. ($100M+ Revenue OR 250+ employees) with ICP
2. OR $250K+ ARR with PingCAP
3. OR Forbes 2000 list with Logo usage permission*

KA Focus on: 

- High-priority targets with growth potential 
- OR high revenue contribution ($250K+ ARR) to PingCAP
- OR valuable Logo* to use

These accounts are important but don't require as much strategic focus or tailored service as SKAs.

### Non-KA

1. Any accounts that do not meet the criteria for SKA/KA

Non-KA is lower priority in our sales strategy.
