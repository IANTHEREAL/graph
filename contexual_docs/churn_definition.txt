## Churn Definition

Customer churn is a Cloud/SaaS business metric that measures the number of customers, accounts, contracts, bookings, etc. that a business has lost over a period of time. This metric is important because it directly affects revenue, growth, and profitability.

Below 3 scenarios for Order Renewal are considered as Churn:

1. The renewal order is signed back over 61 days after the service end date of the original order.
2. The service start date of the renewal order is over 1 day after the service end date of the original order.
3. The renewal order cannot be signed back (the customer is lost).

All orders are churned under this customer, then the customer should be churned.
