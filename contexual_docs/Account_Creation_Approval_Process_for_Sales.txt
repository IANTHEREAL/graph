<context>Introduction to the new account creation workflow that addresses data quality issues by implementing a structured review and approval process for converting leads to accounts, which is detailed in the subsequent sections.</context>
## Account Creation Process - Publish to Sales


Currently, we have no review process on account creation, and account data is of lower quality and without compliance check. To ensure account data is clean and accurate and with a purpose of all new account creation should be reviewed and approved. We re-designed the account creation process via the route from Lead Conversion. Below guideline is provided to frontline team for reference.

######
<context>This chunk outlines the workflow procedure for account creation through lead conversion, detailing the two main paths: creating a new account (requiring approvals from sales managers, regional operations, and potentially legal) or choosing an existing account. It serves as the high-level overview before the document explains each step in detail.</context>
## The overview of the Workflow procedure


Scenario category:
- Lead Creation (as normal, no change in current process).
- For new account creation, sales need to create a new lead|Convert the Lead/Submit for Review|Approval Review|Approved|Converted|Active Account

All new accounts will be created from Leads, follow the workflow procedure below:

  - The process starts when Sales create a new lead or accept a lead from MKT in SFDC.
  - Next, Sales convert the Lead.
  - At this point, a decision is made:
    - Path A: Create New Account:
      - If a new account needs to be created, the process moves to Sales rep fill in mandatory account information.
      - The information is then Submitted for Approval.
      - From "Submitted for Approval", there are two potential paths for review:
        - Path A.1 (For NA): The submission goes to Sales Manager Review and Approve (Regional Ops Delegation) for NA. After this review/approval, it proceeds to the next step.
        - Path A.2 (General/After NA Review): The submission (or the result from the NA review) goes to Region Ops Review and Approve.
      - During the Region Ops Review and Approve stage:
        - If Reject to update, the process loops back to Sales rep fill in mandatory account information.
        - If Approve, the process moves to Industry vertical verification.
      - At the Industry vertical verification stage:
        - If Legal approval required, the process moves to Legal Review and Approve. After legal approval, the Lead converted to an account status is reached.
        - If Legal approval Not required, the process bypasses the legal review, and the Lead converted to an account status is reached directly.
    - Path B: Choose Existing Account:
      - If an existing account is chosen, the user proceeds to Submit.
      - After submitting, the Lead converted to an account status is reached.
