## 3 Target Bonus Calculation

### Bonus Calculation Cheat Sheet

1. **Identify the Appropriate Bucket**: Classify each transaction into one of the following categories:
    
    - **Bucket 1 - New & Expansion ACV**
    - **Bucket 2 - Renewal ACV**
    - **Bucket 3 - MBO (Management by Objectives)**

2. **Calculate Annual Contract Value (ACV)**: Determine the ACV for each transaction based on the type of deal and contract duration.

3. **Check for Quota Exceedance**: Compare the calculated ACV with the respective Bucket’s quota to determine if it exceeds the quota.

4. **Determine Personal Commission Rate (PCR)**: Assign the appropriate commission rate based on quota attainment:
    
    - **Base Commission Rate**
    - **Acceleration Commission Rate** (applies to excess portions)
    - **Cloud First Accelerator** (only applicable to Bucket 1 for Brand New Cloud Customers)

5. **Calculate Bonus for Each Portion**: Compute the bonus for each portion of ACV using the determined commission rates:

    - **Bonus Part 1:** Base portion
    - **Bonus Part 2:** Accelerated portion (if applicable)
    - **Cloud First Accelerator Bonus:** (if applicable)

6. **Handle Multi-Year Orders** *(if applicable)*: Determine if the order spans multiple years and calculate future years’ bonuses according to the following rules:

    - **New & Expansion Orders:**
        - **Year 1:** Calculate using Bucket 1
        - **Years 2 & 3:** Calculate at 2% of ACV


    - **Renewal Orders:**
        - **Year 1:** Calculate using Bucket 2
        - **Years 2 & 3:** Calculate at 2% of ACV


    - **Multi-Year Cloud Commitment Plans:** Additional bonuses based on exceeded usage beyond the initial commitment

7. **Aggregate All Bonuses**: Combine all calculated bonus portions to generate the final bonus summary.

### 3.1 Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus

Based on your actual Quota Attainment in each Quarter, PingCAP calculates the aggregated ACVs in deals that you have closed and determines the Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus you are entitled to. In calculating your Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus, PingCAP will take into account the Acceleration Multiplier (as described in Section 1).

Calculation examples are listed below for your reference.

Assume Quota for FY25: 500k, Base Rate: 5%, Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus: 25K

Q1:
- Quota Attainment-Q1 (Cloud) = 100K
- Quota Attainment-Q1 (non-Cloud) = 90K
- Incentive Compensation-Q1 = (100K+90K)*5%=9.5K

Q2:
- Quota Attainment-Q2 (Cloud) = 250k
- Quota Attainment-Q2 (non-Cloud) = 100K
- Incentive Compensation-Q2 =  500K*5%+(350K+190K-500K)*7.5%-9.5K = 18.5K

Note:Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only.

### 3.2 Bucket 2 Total Target Bonus
Based on your actual Quota Attainment in each Quarter, PingCAP calculates the aggregated ACVs in deals that you have closed and determines the Bucket 2 Total Target Bonus you are entitled to.

Calculation examples are listed below for your reference.

Assume Quota for FY25 = 300k, Base Rate = 2%, Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus = 6K

Q1:
- Quota Attainment-Q1 (Cloud): 100K
- Quota Attainment-Q1 (non-Cloud): 90K
- Incentive Compensation-Q1  = (100K+90K)*2% = 3.8K

Q2:
- Quota Attainment-Q2 (Cloud): 100k
- Quota Attainment-Q2 (non-Cloud): 0K
- Incentive Compensation-Q2 = (100K+100K+90K)*2% -3.8K = 2K

Note: Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only. Any ACV Bookings over the corresponding ATR from a single customer will be calculated to Bucket 1 as New & Expansion ACV.

### 3.3 Multi-year Orders’ Compensation

When calculating incentives for multi-year deals, it’s crucial to understand the compensation structure, which is divided into two main categories with an additional note for Cloud Commitment Plans:

- Multi-year New and Expansion Orders
- Multi-year Renewal Orders
- Addit

1. Multi-year New and Expansion Orders

For Multi-year New and Expansion Orders, besides being compensated for Bucket 1 Target Bonus on your Quota Attainment (for Bucket 1) for the 1st year, you are also entitled to another 2% of ACV for the 2nd year and 2% of ACV for the 3rd year. e.g. in FY25, you closed-won a new 2-year-term deal with ACV as of Y (TCV= 2Y); then for Year 1, your compensation is Y * Bucket 1 Personal Commission Rate, for Year 2, your compensation is Y*2%.

2. Multi-year Renewal Orders

Applicability: Primarily for On-Premises (OP) deployments involving renewals of existing contracts.

For Multi-year Renewal Orders, besides being compensated for Bucket 2 Target Bonus for the 1st renewal year, you are also entitled to another 2% of ACV for the 2nd year and 2% of ACV for the 3rd year. E.g. in FY25, you closed-won a renewal 2-year-term deal with ACV as of Z (TCV=2Z); then for Year 1, your compensation is Z*2%, for Year 2, your compensation is Z*2%.

3. Additional Rules for Multi-year Cloud Commitment Plans

For deals under the Cloud Commitment Plan, there are special considerations due to the variable nature of cloud usage. These rules apply in addition to the above compensation structures for both new/expansion and renewal orders:
- if the first year’s usage is over the ACV, the exceeded amount will be considered as the 2nd year’s ACV;
- if the first 2 years’ usage is over 2*ACV, the exceeded amount will be considered as the 3rd year’s ACV.

Notes:

- These additional rules encourage and reward you for driving higher cloud usage beyond the customer’s initial commitment.
- The additional compensation for exceeded usage is on top of the standard multi-year compensation for the committed ACV.

4.2.3 If you transfer to a non-Sales role or do not act as the Account Owner to any
specific customer before the order amount is fully revrec’ed or collected, you are entitled to the to-be-paid compensation after PingCAP recognizes or collects the remaining order amount within 1) 90 days after your transfer date, 2) 45 days after the next payment due date from the invoices of your active orders, which one is earlier. After this date, the new sales account owner will get compensation based on 2% commission rate and the remaining revenue or collection, which one is less; if the new sales account owner is not onboard, the original sales account owner will get compensation based on 2% commission rate and the remaining revenue or collection, which one is less. However, if you resign from PingCAP before the receivable order amount is fully RevReced or Collected, you shall not be entitled to the to-be-paid compensation any longer. There will be a true-up or true-down based on the actual ACV, revenue and collections as of your last working day; if the commission amount calculated based on the actual ACV, revenue or collections is lower than the commission already paid, the overpaid commission will be clawed back. The unpaid compensation as of your last working day, will be paid to you according to PingCAP's scheduled commission pay dates, subject to terms and conditions provided hereunder; if local law provides otherwise, local law shall prevail.
