# PoC Application Process (for Global Business)​

Draft by: Business Enabling & Operation

Last Update: 24/7/2024

In order to record PoC application and track PoC status, we optimize PoC application function in Salesforce and Lark/Feishu. Now all PoC requests shall go through Salesforce and be approved as below instructions. PoC status shall be updated by the PoC owner (Sales/Presales) in a timely manner. ​


## Apply in TiDBCloud

There are 2 ways to request TiDB Cloud PoC: requested directly by the Cloud User in the TiDB Cloud UI by clicking "Apply for a PoC Trial"; OR requested by Sales in Salesforce. The approvals flow as below:​

### 1. Requested byUser in TiDBCloud UI​

Non Presales Auto-approval will go to GPE (SLA = 24 hours);​ Otherwise, the approval process is within regional teams and final approval by regional GM.​

### 2. Requested by Sales in Salesforce​

Non Presales Auto-approval will go to GPE (SLA = 24 hours);​ Otherwise, the approval process is within regional teams and final approval by regional GM.​

### 3. Credits adding during PoC​

If the credits have been used up but PoC is still ongoing, pls request more credits in Salesforce "Cloud User Request" object, create one "Adding Credits Request" and submit for approval.​

Credits adding approval process is: ​
- If Credits Needed <=3,000 AND Accumulated Credits <=10,000, Sales Trigger > Sales Manager (for APAC) > Regional Leader > RDG Product Readiness > Finance > End
- If Credits Needed >3,000OR Accumulated Credits >10,000, Sales Trigger > Sales Manager (for APAC) > Regional Leader > RDG Product Readiness > Finance > End
