### Lead Actions


The MQLs are assigned to you as “Open” by default.

2. If you get engagements with the Lead (call, emails, WhatsApp, etc.), pls update to “Engaged”.
3. If you schedule the first meeting with the Lead, pls update to “Meeting Scheduled”.
4. If you complete the first meeting, pls update to “Meeting Completed”.
5. If during the above steps, you find it’s disqualified, pls update to “Disqualified”.
6. If during the above steps, you find it’s not disqualified but no Opp in the next 6~12 months, pls update to “Nurture”.
7. If during the above steps, the Lead is qualified to be an Opp, pls convert it.
8. If the Lead stays at “Open” for over 30 days, or stays at “Working” for over 3 months, it will be updated to “MKT Nurture” automatically.
