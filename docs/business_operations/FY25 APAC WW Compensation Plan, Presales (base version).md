### 2.1 Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus

Based on your actual Quota Attainment in each Quarter, PingCAP calculates the aggregated ACVs in deals that you have closed and determines the Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus you are entitled to. In calculating your Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus, PingCAP will take into account the Acceleration Multiplier (as described in Section 1).

Calculation examples are listed below for your reference.

Assume Quota for FY25:
  - Quota for Wetech: 1.25M
  - Quota for Others: 0.8M
  - Bucket 1 Total Target Bonus: 2.5K

Q1:
  - Q1 Contribution Rate: 90%
  - Q1 ACV (Wetech): 0.5M
  - Q1 ACV (Others): 0.1M
  - Quota Attainment: = 0.5/1.25 * 30% + 0.1/0.8 * 70% = 20.75%
  - Incentive Compensation-Q1 = = 2.5K * 20.75% * 1 * 90% = 5.19K * 90% = 0.467K

Q2:
  - Q2 Contribution Rate: 110%
  - H1 ACV (Wetech): 1.5M
  - H1 ACV (Others): 0.9M
  - Quota Attainment: = 1.5/1.25*30%+0.9/0.8*70% = 114.75%
  - Incentive Compensation-Q1 = [2.5K * (100%*1+14.75%*1.5 - 20.75%*1)] * 110% = 2.788K

Note:Within the above calculation, all data is sample for reference only.
