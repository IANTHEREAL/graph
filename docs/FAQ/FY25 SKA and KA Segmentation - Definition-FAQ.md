## Account Segmentation Criteria

### Q4: What are the criteria for an account to qualify as an SKA?
A4: An account qualifies as an SKA if it meets either of the following:
- It is a $500M+ business or has over 1,000 employees AND aligns with one of our unified ICP industry verticals.
- OR it contributes $500K+ in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to PingCAP.

### Q5: What criteria determine if an account is classified as a KA?
A5: An account qualifies as a KA if it meets either of these conditions:
- It is a $250M+ business or has between 500 and 1,000 employees AND belongs to one of our unified ICP industry verticals.
- OR it contributes between $250K and $500K+ in ARR to PingCAP.

### Q6: How are the segmentation criteria structured?
A6: The criteria are measured using two main categories:
- **Category 1: Company Scale and ICP Vertical**  
  This evaluates whether the account meets threshold metrics based on business revenue or employee count (combined with an alignment to selected ICP verticals).
- **Category 2: Annual Revenue Contribution (ARR)**  
  This checks if the account’s annual revenue contribution to PingCAP meets the defined thresholds for either SKA or KA.

### Q7: What are the specific thresholds in Category 1 (Company Scale and ICP Vertical)?
A7: The thresholds are as follows:

| Measurement (Business or Employee Count) + ICP Vertical | SKA                           | KA                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **A. Business Revenue**                                  | Greater than $500M            | Between $250M and $500M     |
| **B. Number of Employees**                               | Greater than 1,000            | Between 500 and 1,000       |

An account must also belong to one of the selected ICP verticals.

### Q8: What are the ARR thresholds in Category 2 (Revenue Contribution)?
A8: The ARR-based criteria are:
- **SKA:** Accounts contributing $500K+ per year.
- **KA:** Accounts contributing between $250K and $500K+ per year.

## Tagging Change Process for Inaccurate Segmentation Tags

### Q11: How often are segmentation tags refreshed?
A11: Segmentation tags are refreshed quarterly by the end of the first month of the following quarter. Any record changes for inaccurate tags must be submitted before the deadline.

### Q12: What is the process for correcting inaccurate segmentation tags?
A12: The process includes:
1. **Submission:** Sales must submit the record change template (available [here](https://pingcap.feishu.cn/wiki/Tc3jwQ3lKi5uzpkyEoUcO3gpnP7?sheet=S86E43)) to Regional Ops.
2. **Review:** Regional Ops reviews the company details and rejects records that do not meet the SKA/KA criteria.
3. **Tag Update:** Regional Ops then forwards the confirmed results to Chen Du, who processes the tagging change in SFDC (Salesforce).

## SKA/KA Exception Approval Process

### Q13: What should I do if my region needs an exception to the standard segmentation tagging?
A13: For special SKA/KA tagging change requests:
1. **Draft an Email:** Sales must draft an email that specifies the Business Justification for the change. This email should include:
   - Account details (employee count, annual revenue, industry, and vertical)
   - Opportunity value, target close dates (both short- and long-term), and a link to the SFDC record
   - Detailed justification for the exception request
2. **Send for Approval:** Send the email to the Regional GM and Ardelle Fan for approval, making sure to CC Max Liu, Ni Jie, Chen Du, and the respective Regional Ops.
3. **Processing:** Once approved, Chen Du will process the tagging change.
