## 2. Reward Structure and Branding Usage

**Q4: How does the marketing reward system determine the reward percentages?**  
A4: The rewards are based on how customer information is used in promotional materials:  
 • **100% Reward:** Granted when the material includes the authorized customer logo (e.g., in text transcripts, case studies, or videos).  
 • **80% Reward:** Given when only the individual’s name and company name are used, without featuring the customer logo.  
 • **70% Reward:** Allocated for anonymous case studies that do not reference the customer by name or logo.

**Q5: Why is it important to include customer logos and identified information in marketing materials?**  
A5: Using the authorized customer logo or proper name helps establish credibility and brand trust. The reward percentages incentivize the most impactful testimonials (with recognizable branding), while still rewarding less direct references when customers opt for limited disclosure.
