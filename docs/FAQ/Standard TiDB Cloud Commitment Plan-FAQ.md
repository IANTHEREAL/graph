## Commitment Terms and Support Plan Requirements

**Q5: What are the commitment term rules outlined in the plan?**  
A5: There are two key rules:
- No special terms are allowed that would let a customer lower the commitment number or terminate the plan before reaching the total minimum commitment amount.
- If a client requests to convert an OP subscription to TiDB Cloud less than 3 months before the subscription end date, that conversion will not qualify for SPIFF incentives.

**Q6: What type of support plan is required for a commitment plan?**  
A6: The customer must opt for a support plan at the Enterprise or Premium level for the entire service period. The support must comply with the predefined support rate without any customizations to the support scope.

## Minimum Commitment Amount (First Year)

**Q7: How is the minimum commitment amount for the first year determined?**  
A7: The first-year minimum commitment is primarily based on the customer's past on-demand spending:
- It must exceed 80% of the last billing month’s on-demand spending multiplied by 12.
- If the last billing month’s on-demand spending is lower than $2K, the commitment must instead be more than 80% of the predictable annual spending on TiDB Cloud, factoring in the product configuration, discount, and support plan.
  
This calculation is designed to ensure that deals reflect a realistic, substantial level of usage.

## Multi-Year Commitment Plans (CP)

**Q8: What is a Multi-Year Commitment Plan (CP)?**  
A8: A Multi-Year Commitment Plan is an agreement where the customer commits to service durations longer than one year—either 2 or 3 years. The plan defines specific thresholds for the minimum commitment amount in the first year relative to the overall Annual Contract Value (ACV).

### Two-Year Commitment Plans

**Q9: How is the first-year commitment structured for a two-year CP?**  
A9: For a two-year commitment plan, the minimum commitment amount for the first year should be at least 80% of the ACV. For example:
- A 100K/100K split has the first year at 100% of the ACV.
- A 100K/150K split brings the first-year commitment to 80% of the ACV.
- A 100K/180K split results in a 71.4% first-year commitment, which does not meet the standard CP requirements.

### Three-Year Commitment Plans

**Q10: How is the first-year commitment structured for a three-year CP?**  
A10: For a three-year commitment plan, the first-year commitment should be no less than 66.6% of the ACV. For example:
- A 100K/100K/100K split means the first year is 100% of the ACV.
- A 100K/150K/200K split yields approximately 66.7% of the ACV in the first year.
- A 100K/200K/300K split results in only 50% of the ACV being committed in the first year, which does not align with the standard CP rules.

---

## Consumption Requirement

**Q11: What is the consumption requirement during the service period?**  
A11: The customer is required to consume at least 15% of the Year 1 commitment amount within the first 3 months. This ensures early adoption of the committed services.

---

## Special Rules for Renew and Early Renew Commitment Plans

**Q12: What are the special conditions for Renew and Early Renew Commitment Plans?**  
A12: For a new CP to be categorized as Renew or Early Renew:
- The new commitment plan must fall under the Renew or Early Renew category.
- The option known as Cancel and Replace is not considered a standard commitment plan for these scenarios.

**Q13: How is the SPIFF calculated in the context of Renew and Early Renew CPs?**  
A13: SPIFF (Sales Performance Incentive Fund) is calculated based on incremental ACV growth. Specifically, the incremental ACV growth is determined by subtracting the ending ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) from the previous quarter from the new commitment plan’s ACV.
