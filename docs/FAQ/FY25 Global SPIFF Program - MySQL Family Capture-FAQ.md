## Eligibility & Qualifications

### Q4: What does it mean to “replace” an existing MySQL cluster under this program?
A: Replacement in this context means that a customer’s existing MySQL cluster is converted or upgraded to a TiDB cluster, which in turn must result in an ARR increase of at least $100K.

### Q5: Are there any special qualification rules for accounts that participated in FY24’s MySQL Family Capture SPIFF?
A: Yes.  
• For TiDB Cloud: If the account already received a MySQL Family Capture SPIFF in FY24, only the incremental ARR growth above the FY24 commitment plan’s ACV will be counted for the FY25 incentive.  
• For TiDB Enterprise: The ARR increase calculation must exclude any growth contributed by a TiDB Enterprise Contract that was signed in FY24 but became effective in FY25.

## Bonus Structure & Payment

### Q6: What is the bonus incentive offered under this program?
A: The program offers a one-time incentive bonus of $3,000 per customer in FY25. This bonus is granted only once for each customer, regardless of multiple replacements.

### Q7: When will the bonus be paid out?
A: Bonuses are paid out during the payroll period of the quarter following when the qualifying criteria have been met.
