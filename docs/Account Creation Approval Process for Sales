Background
Currently, we have no review process on account creation, and account data is of lower quality and without compliance check. To ensure account data is clean and accurate and with a purpose of all new account creation should be reviewed and approved. We re-designed the account creation process via the route from Lead Conversion. Below guideline is provided to frontline team for reference.
