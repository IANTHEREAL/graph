Draft by: Business Enabling and Operation
Last Update: Feb 8th, 2025

A selected number of accounts have been defined as SKA/KA based on our ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) profile.  
These are the accounts **to be focused in your target market in FY25**.

## FY25 Customer Segmentation

### SKA criteria:
- **($500M+ business OR 1000+ employee) AND unified ICP industry**  
- **OR**  
- **$500K+ ARR with PingCAP**  

### KA criteria:
- **($250M+ business OR 500+ employee) AND unified ICP industry**  
- **OR**  
- **$250K+ ARR with PingCAP**  

## Details refer to below:

Overall, we have two categories of measurement when we define SKA/KA, based on:  
1) **Enterprise scale and ICP vertical**  
2) **Annual revenue contribution to PingCAP**  

### Category 1 - Company scale (Revenue Size/# Employees) meets the bar and industry aligns with ICP verticals

| (A OR B) AND (ICP verticals) | SKA          | KA           |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| A. Business Rev.            | >$500M      | $250M~$500M |
| B. Employee #               | >1000       | 500~1000    |

#### ICP Verticals

For ICP verticals, we use only **the below selected Verticals (Level 3)** as ICP verticals for SKA/KA measurement.  
These verticals are with priority or with a use case in your region.
